#String Formatting Practice

# How to use this file:
#  Copy this to your python (.py) file, and write your code in the given space

#Question 1 and 2 below have some variables given which you need to format into presentable output strings.

# 1. first_name = "Eric"
# 	 last_name = "Idle"
# 	 age = 74
# 	 profession = "comedian"
# 	 affiliation = "Monty Python"

# 	 Output: Hello, Eric Idle. You are 74. You are a comedian. You were a member of Monty Python.


# your code goes here

# 2. Let's try on with a dictionary:
#    comedian = {'name': 'Eric Idle', 'age': 74}

#    Output: The comedian is Eric Idle, aged 74.


# your code goes here


#For the next 4 questions guess the output of the blocks of code:

# 3. output = '{:d}'.format(24)
#    print(output)

# 4. output = '{:f}'.format(5.12345678123)
#    print(output)

# 5. data = {'first': 'Place', 'last': 'Holder!'}
#    output = '{first} {last}'.format(**data)
#    print(output)

# 6. from datetime import datetime
#    output='{:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M}'.format(datetime(2016, 7, 26, 3, 57))
#    print(output)
